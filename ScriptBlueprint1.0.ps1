#  Get-Command <SomeCommand> -Syntax
# Will get the commands syntax this way:
#
# EXAMPLE:   Get-Service [[-Name] <string[]>] [-ComputerName <string[]>] [-DependentServices] [-RequiredServices] [-Include <string[]>] [-Exclude <string[]>] [<CommonParameters>]
#                 /\        /\       /\  /\              /\                                                                                                            /\
#                 !!        !!       !!  !!              !!                                                                                                            !!
#               Command  Positional Type Array        Optional                                                                                             Common stuff commands have
#
#               Square brackets mean optional.
#               Square brackets on a Command makes it a Positional Parameter - Meaning you can write the parameter without stating its name in the right position
#               EXAMPLE: Get-Service BITS -ComputerName localhost  -> BITS is a service name, i could write BITS without its parameter name because its the first positional parameter
#               Pointy brackets mean input type -> string int... could include [] to make it an array
#               No brackets means Mandatory (Name of the command is without brackets because it has to be written in order to invoke the command)
#               CommonParameters EXAMPLE: -Verbose            - Confirm           -WhatIf

#region DSC Stuff
#region Intro
# There are 3 types of pull servers in DSC
# SMB
# HTTP
# HTTPS
# With push the protocol used is wsman
# When u encrypt the data with the kerberos ticket u can use WINRM
# To get the registration key and certificate thumbprint to a remote machine you can push these details over push configuration in order to move to pull later
# Remember when publishing a configuration when i create a checksum to use -force otherwise it wont work and the remote nodes will still think the file is the old one
# Import-DscResource -ModuleName PSDesiredStateConfiguration
# This command works only inside a configuration, to get intellisense write an empty configuration block.
# Restore-DscConfiguration -> ROLLBACK (LCM Saved the previous configuration so if a rollback is necessary it will be already on the target nodes for rollback)
# Test-DscConfiguration -Detailed -> checks whether the actual configuration on the nodes matches the desired state configuration
# Means it runs all the test functions that are found inside the configuration
#endregion
#region LCM
# Get LCM -> Local Configuration Manager from a remote machine:
# Remember to enable the psremoting on the remote machine -> Enable-PSRemoting -SkipNetworkProfileCheck
# Then query the machine for its configuration:
# Get-DscLocalConfigurationManager -CimSession 'localhost'
# LCM is in every pc and its default configuration is PUSH There are 4 states to an LCM:
# Idle
# Busy
# PendingReboot
# PendingConfiguration
# To Test the LCM on a machine:
# Get-DscConfigurationStatus -> Check the LCM Status
# Get-DscConfigurationStatus -All -> Check the LCM Status History
# LCM Also has a flag of Action After Reboot (DO NOT MARK THE FLAG AS NO IT WILL FK UP OTHERS CONFIGS) and a debug mode that can pull the configuration from the machine and use remote debugging tools with f11 and all.
# Running the Configuration(by name) Creates the mof file (its the configuration file with everything that needs to be done in the configuration)
# Start-DscConfiguration Pushed the mof file created earlier

##################################################################
#.Synopsis
# Retrieves the memory protections of an arbitrary address.
#.Description
# The Check-MemoryProtection cmdlet returns the memory protections of any memory address.
#
# Check-MemoryProtection is just a wrapper for the Windows API VirtualQuery function that outputs protections in a human-readable format.
#.Parameter Address
# Specifies the address whose memory protections are to be queried.
#.Parameter ProcessId
# Queries the memory of the provided process ID.
#.Parameter PageSize
# Specifies the memory page size. This can safely be left to its default of 0x1000 bytes.
#.Outputs
# Winapi.Kernel32+MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION
#     By default, Check-MemoryProtection returns a MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION structure.
#.Example
# C:\PS>$proc = [System.Diagnostics.Process]::GetCurrentProcess()
# 
# C:\PS>$module = $proc.MainModule
# 
# C:\PS>$base = $module.BaseAddress
# 
# C:\PS>Check-MemoryProtection $base
# 
# BaseAddress       : 5363597312
# AllocationBase    : 5363597312
# AllocationProtect : PAGE_EXECUTE_WRITECOPY
# RegionSize        : 4096
# State             : MEM_COMMIT
# Protect           : PAGE_READONLY
# Type              : MEM_IMAGE
# 
# 
# Description
# -----------
# This command returns the memory protections of the currently loaded process' base address. In this example, the memory address queried is the base address of powershell.exe
#.Example
# C:\PS>$proc = ps cmd
# 
# C:\PS>$base = $proc.MainModule.BaseAddress
# 
# C:\PS>Check-MemoryProtection $base $proc.Id

#.Description
# The Dump-Strings cmdlet retrieves strings from the memory of any process.
#
# Dump-Strings will print both ASCII and Unicode strings to stdout. Its functionality is similar to Sysinternals strings.exe but it operates in memory.
#.Parameter Address
# Specifies the memory base address.
#.Parameter Offset
# Specifies the number of bytes to process.
#.Parameter ProcessId
# Dumps the strings of the process whose ID was specified. Not specifying a process ID will result in querying the address space of powershell.exe.
#.Parameter Encoding
# Specifies the string encoding to use. The default option is 'DEFAULT' which will return both ASCII and Unicode. The other options are 'ASCII' and 'UNICODE'
#.Parameter MinimumLength
# Specifies the minimum length string to return. The default length is 3.
#.Parameter StringOffset
# Specifies the offset in memory where the string occurs.
#.Example
# C:\PS>$proc = Get-Process cmd
# 
# C:\PS>$module = $proc.MainModule
# 
# C:\PS>$size = $module.ModuleMemorySize

#
#    Specifies the process for which a dump will be generated. The process object
#    is obtained with Get-Process.
#
#.PARAMETER DumpFilePath
#
#    Specifies the path where dump files will be written. By default, dump files
#    are written to the current working directory. Dump file names take following
#    form: processname_id.dmp
#
#.EXAMPLE
#
#    Out-Minidump -Process (Get-Process -Id 4293)
#
#    Description
#    -----------
#    Generate a minidump for process ID 4293.
#
#.EXAMPLE
#
#    Get-Process lsass | Out-Minidump

# User Key                    -  When a user is created, the password is used to create the user key.
#                                The user key is stored with the user's object in the Active Directory.
#                                At the workstation, the user key is created when the user logs on.
#                                This key is the Hash of the Users Password
# Ticket Granting Service Key -  
# TGS Session Key             -  Keys that are disposed after that session 
# Service Key                 -  Services use a key based on the account password they use to log on
#                                All KDCs in the same realm use the same service key.
#                                This key is based on the password assigned to the krbtgt account.
#                                Every Active Directory domain will have this built-in account.
# Inter-realm keys            -  In order for cross-realm authentication to occur, the KDCs must share an inter-realm key.
#                                The realms can then trust each other because they share the key.
#                                This key is the trust password
# Session Key                 -  Keys that are disposed after that session

# Kerberos In Same Domain Steps:
# 1. User Hash to request TGT
# 2. TGT encrypted with krbtgt hash
# 3. TGS Request for Service Ticket
# 4. Service Ticket for server encrypted with Servers Account Hash
# 5. Present the Server with Service Ticket encoded with servers account hash
# 6. (Optional)  When the client on the user's workstation receives KRB_AP_REP,
#                Tt decrypts the service's authenticator with the session key it shares with the service and compares the time returned by the service with the time in the client's original authenticator.
#                If the times match, the client knows that the service is genuine.
#(PAC - Privilege Attribute Certificate, User SID + Groups and nested clams and other login info inside the service ticket this is used to create the users access token)

# Kerberos With a Trusted Domain Steps:
# 1. User Hash to request TGT
# 2. TGT encrypted with krbtgt hash
# 3. TGS Request for Service Ticket
# 4. Inter Realm TGT encrypted with Inter Realm Trust Key(The trust password)
# 5. TGS request for server with inter realm TGT
# 6. Service ticket for server encoded with servers account hash
# 7. Present the Server with Service Ticket encoded with servers account hash

# Random Facts:
# Machine Account password is rerandomed every 30 days
# Microsoft currently uses MD4 to hash credentials, STEALING THE HASH IS LIKE STEALING THE PASSWORD thats why its weakly hashed
# Session key is by default for 10 hours
# Unicodepwd - the attribute in the computer account and the user account that stores the password
# When you gpupdate it creates a kerberos ticket as well, you will see it on klist
# \\127.0.0.1 - is NTLM
# \\FQDN or \\HOSTNAME is Kerberos
# RID Master Role gives 500 SIDs to a DC as an RID pool by default, DCs ask to renew if the pool is at half capacity
# How does the KDC determine exacly what key to use when encrypting these service tickets? -> SPN!
# The DCs in the domain with the application has the SPN. Host based spns are auto generated for built in services...
# in reallity SPNs are only created for the host service and all built in services use that.
# When a domain user requests access to \\FQDN\C$  the KDC maps this request to Host\FQDN SPN, this means that the hash of the target machine
# that exists both in NTDS.DIT and localy on the host. This is used to encrypt the server part of the TGS. Then the ticket is presented to target host
# and that host determines if access is permited.

#region Im Reading About ATA and Active Directory Attacks
#region ATA - Advances Threat Analytics
# How does ATA work - It uses a network parsing engine to capture and parse network traffic of multiple protocols(for example Kerberos,DNS,RPC,NTLM,etc...)
# To do this the ata does Port mirroring from Domain Controllers and DNS servers to the ATA Gateway
# Port mirroring is used on a network switch to send a copy of network packets seen on one switch port (or an entire VLAN) to a network monitoring connection on another switch port
# and/or Deploying an ATA Lightweight Gateway (LGW) directly on Domain Controllers
# ATA could also get info from logs and events on the network.
# This is in order to learn the behavior of users and other entities in the organization.
# ATA can take logs from:
# SIEM Integration
# Windows Event Forwarding(WEF)
# Directly from the Windows Event Collector (for the Lightweight Gateway)
# What does ATA do?
# ATA technology detects multiple suspicious activities, focusing on several phases of the cyber-attack kill chain including:
# Reconnaissance, during which attackers gather information on how the environment is built, what the different assets are, and which entities exist. They generally building their plan for the next phases of the attack.

#endregion
#region Kerberoasting without mimikatz:
# We generally don’t care about host-based SPNs.
# As a computer’s machine account password is randomized by default and rotates every 30 days.
# Arbitrary SPNs can also be registered for domain user accounts as well. 
# If we have an arbitrary SPN that is registered for a domain user account,
# then the NTLM hash of that user’s account’s plaintext password is used for the service ticket creation.
# This is the key to Kerberoasting.
# Any user can request a TGS for any service that has a registered SPN (HOST or arbitrary) in a user or computer account in Active Directory.
# Remember that just requesting this ticket doesn’t grant access to the requesting user
# The server/service to ultimately determine whether the user should be given access.
# Because part of a TGS requested for an SPN instance is encrypted with the NTLM hash of a service account’s plaintext password,
# any user can request these TGS tickets and then crack the service account’s plaintext password offline.

# 
# The LDAP source to search through, e.g. "LDAP://OU=secret,DC=testlab,DC=local"
# Useful for OU queries.
# 
# .PARAMETER SearchBasePrefix
# 
# Specifies a prefix for the LDAP search string (i.e. "CN=Sites,CN=Configuration").
# 
# .PARAMETER Server
# 
# Specifies an Active Directory server (domain controller) to bind to for the search.
# 
# .PARAMETER SearchScope
# 
# Specifies the scope to search under, Base/OneLevel/Subtree (default of Subtree).

# 
# .DESCRIPTION
# 
# Implements code from Get-NetUser to quyery for user accounts with non-null service principle

#region AD Permissions: Exploiting Weak Permissions
# Simple attack method is to find groups that have the managed by feature enabled(See that in properties of group)
# This means that the manager can edit the permissions of the group.
# This is kind of negletable but if you have a user that can manage an important group it could be nice.
# Also considering scanning ACLs of Objects in the directory and complexly filtering them is worth looking at.
# SID of 500 is the default admin account
# SID of 512 is domain admins
# SID of 1000 is one of the first sids in the first user in the domain (Non default one) (I tested in AD16)
# SID of 1001 is the first domain controller in the domain                               (I tested in AD16)
# BloodHound with AD:
# https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound Open source sick stuff
# Scans for these vulnerabilities ACEs(Access control entry) in an ACL(Access control list) -
# Reset Password – The ability to change the password of a user account without knowing their existing password
# Add Members – Having the ability to add users to a particular group
# Full Control – You can do anything you want to a user or group
# Write Owner / Write DACL – The right to change permissions and ownership over an object
# Write – The ability to write object attributes
# Extended Rights – This controls various extended rights in one permission, including reset password rights
# BloodHound is basicaly a tool of analasis of ACLs to create attack paths with one or more exploited vulnerablities.
# UserHunter is the process of hunting for users and machines in the domains
# In PowerView this is dont like so:
# For Invoke-UserHunter
# The script will first query the members of the target group (“Domain Admins” by default).
# Then the script will query the domain for all machines using Get-NetComputers.
# After the script will perform a Get-NetSessions and Get-NetLoggedOn against every host in the list and look for the users previously queried.
# StealthUserHunter does the same thing but does not target the entire domain, only places that are likely to bring value data(Fileshares and DCs)

#region DCShadow  - What I Learned
# This method utilizes trusts in the forest in order to infiltrate the target domain.
# Then run your own DC therefore negating the siem(the thing that processes the logs in real time)
# In order to discover the trust relationships in the current domain you are inside you can user a simple query,
# this information is open to any user(including the trusted ones)
# Getting the trust information:
# 1.Get-ADTrust
# 2.nltest.exe /domain_trusts
# 3.can also use dsa.msc query a custom search for trusted domain objects where the value name is present
# Better techniches:
# Method 1:Partition data:
# Every DC contains the configuration partition, this partition stores configuration objects for the entire forest(the same in the whole forest)
# The configuration partition includes the definition of the Domains(AD partitions) in cn=partitions,cn=configuration,dc=forestRootDomain
# This gains the info of the domain list in the forest
# Can also use adsi edit to connect to configuration partition and browse to partitions and then configuration.
# Ive checked with a no privilages user and it can do this
# Method 2: SID lookup
# CN=ForeignSecurityPrincipals - This is a container that holds objects of the class foreignSecurityPrincipal.
# These objects represent security principals from trusted domains external to the forest, and allow foregin security principals to become members of groups within the domain
# SID-History attribute - an attribute that stores the History of the object moving from one domain to another.
# When an object moves from one domain to another the SID must change, therefore there is an attribute that keeps the history of the old seeds.
# If the attribute is empty the object was never moved out of the domain.
# The Tokens created to a user in another domain that has SIDHistory represent both the new and old seeds therefore can access resources in the old domain(with his old SID) and resources in the new domain(with his new SID)
# This method has been created for situations that there is one old domain that is being re-created to a new one but they co-exist in the proccess and new users in the new domain need access to resources still remaining in the old domain
# If you remove the last part of the SID of a foreign user you get the SID of a Foreign Domain
# Then in order to ensure this domain exists you so an SID Translation.
# SIDs are translatble to users and the other way around this way:
# $objUser = New-Object System.Security.Principal.NTAccount("yotam","amish") # First comes the domain name then the user logon name for AD, For local accounts provide just the name of the account
# $strSID = $objUser.Translate([System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier])
# $strSID.Value
# $objSID = New-Object System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier("S-1-5-21-1604102931-1806437862-1415400612-1104")
# $objUser = $objSID.Translate( [System.Security.Principal.NTAccount])
# $objUser.Value
# How SIDs work:
# S-1-5-21-1604102931-1806437862-1415400612-1104
# (1) revision level                    - Indicates the version of the SID structure that is used in a particular SID. The structure used in all SIDs that are created by a Windows Server 2003 operating system and earlier versions is revision level 1.
# (5) An identifier authority value     - Identifies the highest level of authority that can issue SIDs for a particular type of security principal.
# (21-1604102931-1806437862-1415400612) - Domain identifier
# (1104)                                - Relative identifier
# Method 3: Domain Locator
# nltest /Server:DC1 /DsGetDC:amish.tamesh
# nltest /Server:DC2 /DsGetDC:yotam.nordman
# This works both ways and gets me a DC from the domain that i asked for by asking a dc in my domain, also gets me the forest name.


# I now have the info needed.
# How to register a DC?
# no need to be a member of the domain controllers group
# 1. A change in the configuration partition
# CN=Configuration,CN=Sites,DC=yotam,DC=nordman,CN=Default-First-Site-Name -> need to create a server with NTDS settings.
# This modification is disabled by default
# DrsAddEntry is not limited to DC registration
# 2. A modification of the SPN of a computer account that the attacker owns
# Running a DC stuff needed
# 1. Imporsonate the computer account to use its SPN
# 2. Run a RPC server listening for minimal APIs (in mimikatz its like DrsGetNCChanges - dcsync)
# 3. Trigger a replication -
# By using DrsReplicaAdd, requires permissions
# Or wait 15 minutes
# mimikatz provides commands to run the rpc server and push changes, and a special wininternals trick to modify the AD database
# Detecting this, using LDP.exe or using repadmin /showobjmeta <DB> <Object>
# There u can see the originating DSA(the dc that did it) and the time
# Tracking Schema changes,
# There is an attribute called schemainfo that can track schema changes

#region My Test environmet
#Setup:
# Create 4 VMs - DC1 - winserver16 - DC2 -winserver16 - C1 - win10 1709 - C2 - win10 1709
# All VMs have 2gb ram and 1 core and are at local NAT VMNET 0 stored in a single file not multiple(this is with vmware)
# Drop windows firewall at firewall settings
# Define static ips for all and disable ipv6(it becomes default if its enabled)
# Change the computer name to the name of the VM for comfort
# Set a Default Admin password because it is a prerequisite for promoting to a domain controller
# Promote the 2 DC Machines to domain controllers each in a different forest
# Set the default domain admin password
# In network settings in the client machines use the Corresponding DCs as prefered DNS
# Join the client machines, one into each domain
# Define a DNS stub zone so they can recognize each other in prep of the trust
# Download RSAT(Remote server Administration Tools) KB and install it on client machines
# Checkpoint 1: Shut down all machines for an offline snapshot. Then bring them back on
# If I now ping the counterpart domain name it replies ipv4.
# Now with Active directory domains and trusts, under properties there is the trust wizard
# Created a 2 direction forest trust. and validated on the other side in the same place where the trust wizard is
# After ive validated on the 2nd domain, ive confirmed the end of the wizard in the 1st domain
# Check if i can get the trust with the domain admin account from the client machine:
# ipmo act*
# Get-ADTrust -Filter *
# I get the trust
# Now log on to the same machine with a non privilaged account(only member of domain users) do the same commands:
# I get the trust
# I get also log on with a user from domain 1 to a machine in domain 2
# nltest.exe /domain_trusts works with both privilaged and unprivilaged users.

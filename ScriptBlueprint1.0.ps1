#  Get-Command <SomeCommand> -Syntax
# Will get the commands syntax this way:
#
# EXAMPLE:   Get-Service [[-Name] <string[]>] [-ComputerName <string[]>] [-DependentServices] [-RequiredServices] [-Include <string[]>] [-Exclude <string[]>] [<CommonParameters>]
#                 /\        /\       /\  /\              /\                                                                                                            /\
#                 !!        !!       !!  !!              !!                                                                                                            !!
#               Command  Positional Type Array        Optional                                                                                             Common stuff commands have
#
#               Square brackets mean optional.
#               Square brackets on a Command makes it a Positional Parameter - Meaning you can write the parameter without stating its name in the right position
#               EXAMPLE: Get-Service BITS -ComputerName localhost  -> BITS is a service name, i could write BITS without its parameter name because its the first positional parameter
#               Pointy brackets mean input type -> string int... could include [] to make it an array
#               No brackets means Mandatory (Name of the command is without brackets because it has to be written in order to invoke the command)
#               CommonParameters EXAMPLE: -Verbose            - Confirm           -WhatIf

#region DSC Stuff
#region Intro
# There are 3 types of pull servers in DSC
# SMB
# HTTP
# HTTPS
# With push the protocol used is wsman
# When u encrypt the data with the kerberos ticket u can use WINRM
# To get the registration key and certificate thumbprint to a remote machine you can push these details over push configuration in order to move to pull later
# Remember when publishing a configuration when i create a checksum to use -force otherwise it wont work and the remote nodes will still think the file is the old one
# Import-DscResource -ModuleName PSDesiredStateConfiguration
# This command works only inside a configuration, to get intellisense write an empty configuration block.
# Restore-DscConfiguration -> ROLLBACK (LCM Saved the previous configuration so if a rollback is necessary it will be already on the target nodes for rollback)
# Test-DscConfiguration -Detailed -> checks whether the actual configuration on the nodes matches the desired state configuration
# Means it runs all the test functions that are found inside the configuration
#endregion
#region LCM
# Get LCM -> Local Configuration Manager from a remote machine:
# Remember to enable the psremoting on the remote machine -> Enable-PSRemoting -SkipNetworkProfileCheck
# Then query the machine for its configuration:
# Get-DscLocalConfigurationManager -CimSession 'localhost'
# LCM is in every pc and its default configuration is PUSH There are 4 states to an LCM:
# Idle
# Busy
# PendingReboot
# PendingConfiguration
# To Test the LCM on a machine:
# Get-DscConfigurationStatus -> Check the LCM Status
# Get-DscConfigurationStatus -All -> Check the LCM Status History
# LCM Also has a flag of Action After Reboot (DO NOT MARK THE FLAG AS NO IT WILL FK UP OTHERS CONFIGS) and a debug mode that can pull the configuration from the machine and use remote debugging tools with f11 and all.
# Running the Configuration(by name) Creates the mof file (its the configuration file with everything that needs to be done in the configuration)
# Start-DscConfiguration Pushed the mof file created earlier

##################################################################
#.Synopsis
# Retrieves the memory protections of an arbitrary address.
#.Description
# The Check-MemoryProtection cmdlet returns the memory protections of any memory address.
#
# Check-MemoryProtection is just a wrapper for the Windows API VirtualQuery function that outputs protections in a human-readable format.
#.Parameter Address
# Specifies the address whose memory protections are to be queried.
#.Parameter ProcessId
# Queries the memory of the provided process ID.
#.Parameter PageSize
# Specifies the memory page size. This can safely be left to its default of 0x1000 bytes.
#.Outputs
# Winapi.Kernel32+MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION
#     By default, Check-MemoryProtection returns a MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION structure.
#.Example
# C:\PS>$proc = [System.Diagnostics.Process]::GetCurrentProcess()
# 
# C:\PS>$module = $proc.MainModule
# 
# C:\PS>$base = $module.BaseAddress
# 
# C:\PS>Check-MemoryProtection $base
# 
# BaseAddress       : 5363597312
# AllocationBase    : 5363597312
# AllocationProtect : PAGE_EXECUTE_WRITECOPY
# RegionSize        : 4096
# State             : MEM_COMMIT
# Protect           : PAGE_READONLY
# Type              : MEM_IMAGE
# 
# 
# Description
# -----------
# This command returns the memory protections of the currently loaded process' base address. In this example, the memory address queried is the base address of powershell.exe
#.Example
# C:\PS>$proc = ps cmd
# 
# C:\PS>$base = $proc.MainModule.BaseAddress
# 
# C:\PS>Check-MemoryProtection $base $proc.Id
# 
# BaseAddress       : 1246035968
# AllocationBase    : 1246035968
# AllocationProtect : PAGE_EXECUTE_WRITECOPY
# RegionSize        : 4096
# State             : MEM_COMMIT
# Protect           : PAGE_READONLY
# Type              : MEM_IMAGE
# 
# 
# Description
# -----------
# This command returns the memory protections of cmd.exe.
#.Example
# C:\PS>Check-MemoryProtection 0x00000000
# 
# BaseAddress       : 0
# AllocationBase    : 0

# The Dump-Memory cmdlet displays the contents of memory to stdout. You also have the option to dump raw memory to disk.
#.Parameter Address
# Specifies the base address of memory that is to be dumped.
#.Parameter Offset
# Specifies the number of bytes to dump.
#.Parameter ProcessId
# Dumps the memory of the process whose ID was specified.
#.Parameter Width
# Specifies how many bytes to print per line when outputting to stdout
#.Parameter DumpToFile
# Specifies the path to the output file.
# 
# When this option is specified, memory will not be displayed on stdout.

#.Description
# The Dump-Strings cmdlet retrieves strings from the memory of any process.
#
# Dump-Strings will print both ASCII and Unicode strings to stdout. Its functionality is similar to Sysinternals strings.exe but it operates in memory.
#.Parameter Address
# Specifies the memory base address.
#.Parameter Offset
# Specifies the number of bytes to process.
#.Parameter ProcessId
# Dumps the strings of the process whose ID was specified. Not specifying a process ID will result in querying the address space of powershell.exe.
#.Parameter Encoding
# Specifies the string encoding to use. The default option is 'DEFAULT' which will return both ASCII and Unicode. The other options are 'ASCII' and 'UNICODE'
#.Parameter MinimumLength
# Specifies the minimum length string to return. The default length is 3.
#.Parameter StringOffset
# Specifies the offset in memory where the string occurs.
#.Example
# C:\PS>$proc = Get-Process cmd
# 
# C:\PS>$module = $proc.MainModule
# 
# C:\PS>$size = $module.ModuleMemorySize
# 
# C:\PS>$base = $module.BaseAddress

function Out-Minidump
{
#
#.SYNOPSIS
#
#    Generates a full-memory minidump of a process.
#
#    PowerSploit Function: Out-Minidump
#    Author: Matthew Graeber (@mattifestation)
#    License: BSD 3-Clause
#    Required Dependencies: None
#    Optional Dependencies: None
#
#.DESCRIPTION
#
#    Out-Minidump writes a process dump file with all process memory to disk.
#    This is similar to running procdump.exe with the '-ma' switch.
#
#.PARAMETER Process
#
#    Specifies the process for which a dump will be generated. The process object
#    is obtained with Get-Process.
#
#.PARAMETER DumpFilePath
#
#    Specifies the path where dump files will be written. By default, dump files
#    are written to the current working directory. Dump file names take following
#    form: processname_id.dmp
#
#.EXAMPLE
#
#    Out-Minidump -Process (Get-Process -Id 4293)
#
#    Description
#    -----------
#    Generate a minidump for process ID 4293.
#
#.EXAMPLE
#
#    Get-Process lsass | Out-Minidump
#
#    Description
#    -----------
#    Generate a minidump for the lsass process. Note: To dump lsass, you must be
#    running from an elevated prompt.
#
#.EXAMPLE
#
#    Get-Process | Out-Minidump -DumpFilePath C:\temp
#
#    Description
#    -----------
#    Generate a minidump of all running processes and save them to C:\temp.
#
#.INPUTS
#
#    System.Diagnostics.Process
#
#    You can pipe a process object to Out-Minidump.
#
#.OUTPUTS
#
#    System.IO.FileInfo
